# ðŸ§  DAM Notes & Codebase

Welcome to my personal codebase repository for the **Higher Degree in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM)**.  
Here I keep my **study notes, exercises, and code examples** from different subjects and technologies Iâ€™ve worked with during my training.

This repository is meant as a **learning archive**, where I document what I learn and experiment with new ideas as I grow as a developer.
